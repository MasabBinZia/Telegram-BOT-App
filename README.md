# Telegram Bot with Bun

This project demonstrates how to create a simple Telegram bot using Bun as the runtime environment. The bot is built using the Telegraf library and runs a Bun server.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) - A fast JavaScript runtime
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (for package management, if needed)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MasabBinZia/Telegram-BOT-App
cd Telegram-BOT-App
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies using Bun:

```bash
bun install
```

### 3. Run the Project

Start the project using Bun:

```bash

```

Your Telegram bot will now be running and accessible. The bot will respond to the `/start` command with a welcome message and a keyboard button that links to your web app.
